# Project Summary

## Overview
This project appears to be a multi-faceted hardware and software development initiative, likely focused on creating electronic devices that interface with various sensors and components. The project includes firmware for microcontrollers, electronic design files, and a JavaScript-based web interface, suggesting a comprehensive approach to both hardware and software development.

### Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
- **Languages**: 
  - C++ (for firmware development)
  - Python (for scripts and utilities)
  - TypeScript (for web applications)
  
- **Frameworks**:
  - KiCad (for electronic design)
  - React (for web applications)

- **Main Libraries**:
  - LVGL (for GUI development in firmware)
  - Protobuf (for data serialization)

## Purpose of the Project
The project aims to develop a set of electronic devices that can communicate with various sensors and provide a user interface through a web application. This likely includes functionalities such as monitoring and controlling hardware components, with a focus on user-friendly interaction via a graphical interface.
